# Stars - Java Example

This is a sample code sample for Oak Ridge National Laboratory Research Software Engineer position. This code sample has 6 classes
and calculates various properties of a star such as its flux and pressure by using the properties of the star. These classes also demonstrate and explain key Object Oriented Programming Principles. There is a stand alone BlackHole class which calculates the schwarzschild radius of a Blackhole.
 
 This code sample demonstrates several key features in Java's Object Oriented Programming
 * Use of Classes and Objects.
 * Use of Data Encapsulation.
 * Inheritance relationship between a parent and a child class.
 * Compile Time Polymorphism in Java through constructor overloading.
 * Runtime Polymorphism in Java thorugh method overriding.
 * Method overriding through Hashcode() and Equals() methods.
 * Use of Java Collections through Hashsets for storing custom BlackHole objects.
 * Getting standard user input through the use of Scanner function.
 * Writing unit tests for various classes through the Junit Framework.
 * Code Documentation in the separate word doc and Github readme file.
 * Using Git for version control.
 * Use of Guthub Markdown for documenting github repositories.
